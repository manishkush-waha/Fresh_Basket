        <p class="mb-4">
            To mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, Fresh Basket ensures that all user inputs are sanitized and
            escaped before rendering them on the frontend. Additionally, Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are
            implemented to restrict the execution of unauthorized scripts.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            For Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, the application uses CSRF tokens. These tokens are
            generated on the server and validated with each request to ensure that only legitimate requests are
            processed.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2">SQL Injection</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Although Fresh Basket uses MongoDB, which is not directly vulnerable to traditional SQL injection, it still
            implements robust query validation to prevent NoSQL injection attacks. Mongoose ORM is used to validate and
            sanitize inputs before executing database queries, ensuring that malicious payloads are not processed.
        </p>

                access sensitive data.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Periodic security audits are conducted to identify and address
                vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Rate Limiting and Throttling</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources, Fresh Basket implements rate limiting and throttling
            mechanisms. These measures include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> Limits the number of requests a user can make within a specific time
                frame using libraries like express-rate-limit.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Blocking:</strong> Temporarily blocks IP addresses that exceed the allowed request limit.
            </li>
            <li><strong>API Throttling:</strong> Ensures that API endpoints are not overwhelmed by excessive requests,
                maintaining application performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Tools like New Relic or Datadog are used to monitor traffic patterns and
                detect anomalies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
